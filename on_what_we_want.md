If we want

If we want, we can stand to each other <br>
and ask each other for help  <br>
If we want, things can be figured out.


If we want, we can look each others in the eyes <br>
without being nervous and never stop. <br>
If we want we can understand each other.


If we want, we can see of each other not as an option <br>
but as the gift we were praying for <br>
If we want we can save each other


If we want, we can be the angel to each other <br>
that gives the spark that saves us <br>
If we want, we can see the gift that we are
