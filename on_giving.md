Sometimes I want to give more than I have. I often can see what people need and want to act on it. Yet, I just realize later, that giving requires having and often I don’t have what they need. That is not the life I wished for but it often is the life I have. I pray, that I will have more in the future to give. It pains me to see the potential and not being able to act on it. The unrealized beauty.
