If we want

If we want, we can stand to each other
and ask each other for help
If we want, things can be figured out.

If we want, we can look each others in the eyes 
without bing nervous and never stop.
If we want we can understand each other.

If we want, we can see of each other not as an option
but as the gift we were praying for
If we want we can save each other

If we want, we can be the angel to each other
that gives the spark that saves us
If we want, we can see the gift that we are
