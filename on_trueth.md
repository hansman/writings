The good thing about trueth is that it is sticky. Don't worry about the story lines that are being constructed, no need to make corrections. Truth has a resilience and presence that eventually comes through, even if narratives or perspectives initially obscure it. The essence stays, as the good thing about truth is that it is sticky and everyone knows that.
